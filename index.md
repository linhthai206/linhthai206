_**Internship at [Indium Corporation](https://www.indium.com/): Business Analytics (May - August 2022)**_

With the Business Analytics team, I created a dashboard report for global account managers as the company enters a new strategic space, Electric Vehicle. The dashboard will become the main tool for identifying and ranking industry customer leads. In another project, I taught myself VBA to enhance plant managers' production planning master file with macros, which reduced their navigation time by 50%.
