_**[Natural Language Processing 10-Ks to Identify Correlations](midterm_report)**_

This report uses textual analysis and sentiment analysis to explore whether there is a correlation between S&P 500 companies' stock returns and positive/negative sentiment. I also performed the 10-K correlational study on three additional topics: COVID, ESG, and Climate Change. The analysis results may give insights into how companies document and mention select topics in their 10-Ks.

_**[Visualizing Industry Patenting Trends](RETech patents/RETech patents)**_

By merging firm data and RETech patent data, I was able to explore patent trends during 1980 - 2010 in sectors Materials, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Healthcare, Financials, and Information Technology. Here, “RETech” measures whether the patent pertains to a technological area that is rapidly evolving or stable.

_**[Team project - Data Science for Finance](https://williamroth82.github.io/BozandtheBozzers/)** (May 2023)__

For our final group project in FIN 377 - Data Science for Finance, we analyzed the relationship between rising sea levels and housing prices. Using linear regression analysis and predictions, we compared coastal and inland house prices and examined the effects of sea levels for the period 2017-2021. One of our conclusions is that, as the sea level rose, inland housing prices grew at a greater rate than comparable coastal properties. This project will help inform real estate research and development initiatives amidst climate change and rising sea levels.

_**Internship at [Indium Corporation](https://www.indium.com/): Business Analytics** (May - December 2022)_

With the Business Analytics team, I created a dashboard report for global account managers as the company enters a new strategic space, Electric Vehicle. The dashboard will become the main tool for identifying and ranking industry customer leads. In another project, I taught myself VBA to enhance plant managers' production planning master file with macros, which reduced their navigation time by **50%.** After the summer internship, I continued working part-time with Indium until December 2022.

_**[Visualizing Shifts in Society](https://societalshifts.com/)** (September - December 2020)_

These shifts are Changing Demographics, Urbanization, Climate Change, Energy Generation & Storage, AI & Tech Innovation, Big Data, Blockchain, and Social Commerce. I collected and summarized the trend data for Climate Change and Social Commerce with graphical reports.
